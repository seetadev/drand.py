# drand.py

A Python client library for interacting with the drand distributed randomness beacon network. This library provides a simple and efficient way to fetch verifiable randomness from drand networks, with support for both public and private drand chains.

## üöÄ Features

- **Distributed Randomness Access**: Connect to drand networks to fetch cryptographically secure randomness
- **Multiple Network Support**: Works with various drand networks and chains
- **Verification Capabilities**: Built-in verification of randomness beacon signatures
- **Docker Support**: Complete containerized development and deployment environment
- **Development Network**: Includes a local 5-node drand network for testing and development
- **REST API Integration**: Seamless integration with drand's HTTP API endpoints
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Full Sphinx documentation with examples

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

## üîß Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Docker (>= 17.12) and Docker Compose (>= 1.18) for development network
- pip package manager

### Installation Steps

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/anisharma07/drand.py.git
cd drand.py

# Install in development mode
pip install --editable .[dev]

# Or install from source
python setup.py install
```

### Docker Development Setup

```bash
# Build and run the development environment
docker-compose up -d

# For interactive development
docker-compose run --rm drand python
```

## üéØ Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
from drand import DrandClient

# Initialize client
client = DrandClient()

# Fetch latest randomness
randomness = client.get_latest()
print(f"Random value: {randomness}")

# Fetch specific round
round_randomness = client.get_round(12345)
print(f"Round 12345: {round_randomness}")
```

### Development Network

Start a local 5-node drand network for testing:

```bash
cd devnet
./run.sh
```

This creates a threshold network (3 out of 5 nodes) with 10-second randomness periods.

### API Interaction

Query the development network directly:

```bash
# Linux/macOS
curl CONTAINER_IP:8080/api/public

# Alternative (works on all platforms)
docker exec drand1 call_api
```

### Production Usage

```bash
# Connect to mainnet drand network
python -c "
from drand import DrandClient
client = DrandClient(network='mainnet')
print(client.get_latest())
"
```

## üì± Platform Support

- **Linux**: Full support with native Docker integration
- **macOS**: Supported with Docker for Mac (note: direct container IP access limitations)
- **Windows**: Supported via Docker Desktop
- **Python Versions**: 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11+

## üß™ Testing

```bash
# Run the test suite
python -m pytest tests/

# Run tests in Docker
docker-compose run --rm drand python -m pytest tests/

# Run with coverage
python -m pytest tests/ --cov=drand
```

## üìö Documentation

Build and view documentation locally:

```bash
# Build documentation
docker-compose -f docs.yml run --rm builddocs

# Serve documentation
docker-compose -f docs.yml up viewdocs

# Access at http://localhost:57781
```

## üîÑ Deployment

### Docker Deployment

```bash
# Build production image
docker build -t drand-py .

# Run in production
docker run -d --name drand-client drand-py
```

### PyPI Package

```bash
# Build distribution
python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel

# Upload to PyPI
twine upload dist/*
```

## üìä Performance & Optimization

- **Efficient HTTP Client**: Optimized for drand's REST API
- **Connection Pooling**: Reuses connections for multiple requests
- **Caching Support**: Built-in caching for frequently accessed rounds
- **Async Support**: Non-blocking operations for high-throughput applications
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Lightweight with minimal external dependencies

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

- **Signature Verification**: All randomness beacons are cryptographically verified
- **Network Security**: Support for TLS-encrypted connections
- **Chain Verification**: Validates the integrity of randomness chains
- **Trusted Setup**: Uses well-established drand networks with known public keys
